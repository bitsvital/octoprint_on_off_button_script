## About
Raspberry Pi Power On / Power Off Script is  basic script for your Raspberry Pi's that works along side a push button that is wired to your Raspberry Pi. As of 2022-02-15, Raspberry Pi's do not come with an on/off power button. Without a power on/off button, you are left with having to power off the shell two ways. One (1), if you have a GUI desktop installed, you can Restart/Power Off the Raspberry Pi through the GUI. Two (2), at the command line invoke the shutdown procedure `sudo shutdown -now` or `sudo shutdown -h now`.
