## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
Bullying, harassing, and disrespecting anyone, including humans, animals, and our planet, is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN at BitsVital, including anyone that interacts with BitsVital, our community, and members. You will be immediately banned with no warning. At BitsVital, we lift people up, help animals/creatures, and our planet!

## Please and Thank You
As social media becomes increasingly popular and writing and responding becomes anonymous with no source of being held accountable for what we say, it's easy to become un-human. We need to remember we are human, and our fellow humans have emotions and feelings. We are not computers! "Please" and "Thank You" go a long way. I, David Swanson the CEO of BitsVital, recently posted on StackOverFlow that included these lines in my post: "Thank You", and another post "I hope this helps :)" both of these lines were removed by the same moderator. When I pushed for an answer on why I was told because it was extra text, and we try to be as efficient as possible. I love efficiency, but once again, we need to draw a line and remind ourselves that we are not computers AND that's a good thing! We are far more advance with our emotions and feelings. I find it totally unacceptable what the StackOverFlow moderator removed these lines and that StackOverFlow corporate agrees. If you **DO** find it acceptable what StackOverFlow did, then BitsVital is not for you. At BitsVital we encourage **"Please"** and **"Thank You"**. We encourage adding emojis to show your feelings. However, common sense is an amazing thing. And when using emojis there are some emojis that are unacceptable, and overuse of emojis can be just as annoying by not saying Please and Thank You. This is where common sense comes into play.

If you send a message or post demanding that something is added to the program, Ex. This needs to be fixed now!. Your message will be ignored, and most likely deleted. Compared to saying. Can you please fix this as soon as possible?.

## Diversity
BitsVital is a safe community for everyone. No matter where you are from, your culture, religion, age, disability,
gender identity, sexual identity/orientation, economic situation, language, knowledge, personal appearance, race,
ethnicity, or any other attribute.

Diversity makes all of us stronger! We encourage diversity at BitsVital. With diversity and the amazing multitude of languages in our world, we seem to find that it can be very easy to disrespect another individual due to their different culture and language. This is **FORBIDDEN** at BitsVital. We lift people up of all cultures and encourage everyone from North to South, To East To West to participate! We don't put anyone down. This encompasses spelling and grammar mistakes. The internet has connected our amazing world. We have to remember that our community is open to the world and someone from on,e country may not speak your language or able to write in that language efficiently. There are individuals like myself that have severe dyslexia. When asking for help, posting commenting, etc. it may be difficult for that person to post in your language. Instead of ignoring or disrespecting our fellow members it's our responsibility to step up and help them. It may take a little extra work, but we live in the age of computers which includes simple to use and proficient translators. Here at BitsVital, we have created our internet program that utilizes the AWS Translate system to help us translate support tickets, posts, comments, etc. for users that don't speak US English.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all of BitsVital executives, employees, contractors, and community members. This includes where ever our community is communicating and working. This includes but not limited to BitsVital office(s), website, forums, social media sites, communication channels like Discord, NextCloud Talk, Twitch, YouTube Chat, IRC, Slack, AND! in real life!

## A "FEW" Examples of what is **NOT** acceptable behavior
* Sexual harassment of any type is prohibited! In fact, at BitsVital all of our programs, sites, the community is G-rated. Any type of sexual talk is prohibited. There are adult sites for that. We ENCOURAGE children of all ages to code and join our communities. This is a safe place for any age group to learn and participate. Children age 18 and under require a caregivers' permission to participate on the BitsVital site(s).
* Any type of bullying or harassment, and aggression, including public or privately! This includes BUT NOT LIMITED TO disrespecting someone that doesn't use proper grammar or spelling. Asking questions that "YOU" think are obvious. Even if the entire world knows the answer, that one person doesn't, and that's what we're here for To teach and learn. There are times when I knew the answer to the question I was asking without knowing it because it was phrased in a way I didn't understand it; Again, WE ARE HERE TO TEACH AND LEARN. <span style="text-decoration: underline">**We are all teachers....We are all students.**
* DO NOT under no circumstances publish ANYONE's personal/private information online without explicit permission! This includes but is not limited to address, place of work, email address, photos, etc.
* Talking over and Talking down to someone. Examples of talking down are: You should have known that, Duh, What were you thinking, it's obvious, they should have taught that to you in school, even my child knows how to do that, etc.
* Demanding! Ex. I need this done now. Instead, ask politely with please and thank you.
* Trolling!
* Absolutely no personal, racist, sexual, cultural, or political attacks or sny comments.
* Reporting and Retaliating. Reporting is anonymous! If you even suspect or think that someone is violating the code of conduct, we encourage you to report it.
